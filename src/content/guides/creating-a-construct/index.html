    <p>The AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/" target="_blank">Cloud Development Kit</a> offers a powerful and
        flexible way to manage your AWS infrastructure. While the CDK ships with a lot of existing constructs to
        leverage, there are reasons you will need to create your own. Perhaps you want to abstract common infrastructure
        behind something that's easily reusable by your DevOps teams. Or maybe you need to enforce business standards.
        Either way, learning how to make a reusable construct provides huge recurring value over the life of your
        Infrastructure as Code.</p>
    <p>I'm not going to cover much about what makes a good reusable construct (that's coming later). Instead, the goal
        is to show you the
        technical setup of how to get it done. First is creating a JSII module that is our construct, and the second is
        getting it built and published. In this case I'm going to use Github as my git repository and GitHub Actions for
        automatic publishing, leveraging <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jsii-publish" target="_blank">Daniel
            Schroeder's excellent Docker container</a>. For simplicity the construct will be a simple S3
        Bucket with encryption enforced.</p>
    <p>Finally, I'll talk a little bit about the CDK Construct Catalog, and how you can automatically publish to it.</p>

<section class="nice-block">
    <h2>Create a JSII-based construct</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii" target="_blank">JSII</a> is the library that underpins the AWS CDK and
        makes it possible to write a CDK construct once in TypeScript/Javascript and then compile and distribute it for
        other languages like Python, Java, and C#.
    </p>
    <p>Start by creating a new project, following the <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii" target="_blank"> JSII
        docs</a>. Take your time to read the <a href="https://github.com/aws/jsii/blob/master/docs/configuration.md"
                                                target="_blank"> Configuration section</a> as
        there is a lot of useful information, some of which is absolutely required for proper JSII compilation and
        publishing.</p>

    <p>Once done you should have the basic shell of a module. However, the JSII does not bootstrap any testing
        framework, so let's do that now.</p>
    <pre>
         <code class="shell">
 $ npm i --save-dev @types/jest @types/node ts-jest
         </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Let's also go ahead and fill out the <strong>scripts</strong> section of the <i>package.json</i> by adding
        the test/watch scripts:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="json">
"scripts": {
    "build": "jsii",
    "build:watch": "jsii -w",
    "package": "jsii-pacmak",
    "test": "tsc && jest",
    "watch": "tsc -w"
},
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Also, create a <strong>jest.config.js</strong> file in the base dir with the following contents:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="js">
module.exports = {
    "roots": [
        "<rootDir>/"
    ],
    testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
    "transform": {
        "^.+\\.tsx?$": "ts-jest"
    },
};

        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Now we can run some basic Jest tests around our construct with a simple command: </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ npm run test
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>But, we don't have any tests yet, so nothing happens.</p>
    <p>Next we're going to write some unit tests and create a construct. I'm not going to go into details here but
        you should at least see some code. In this case the construct is just going to wrap an S3 Bucket and ensure that
        it always has encryption enabled.</p>
    <p>Don't forget to install some dependencies first, both for the unit testing and for the construct itself:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ npm i -s @aws-cdk/core @aws-cdk/aws-s3
$ npm i --save-dev @aws-cdk/assert
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Here's the test and code:</p>
    <h2>The test: <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/secure-bucket/blob/master/lib/index.test.ts" target="_blank">lib/index.test.ts</a>
    </h2>
    <pre>
        <code class="typescript">
import {SecureBucket} from "../lib/index";
import {App, Stack} from "@aws-cdk/core";
import '@aws-cdk/assert/jest';
import {BucketEncryption} from "@aws-cdk/aws-s3";

test('Has one encrypted Bucket', () => {
    const mockApp = new App();
    const stack = new Stack(mockApp, 'testing-stack');

    new SecureBucket(stack, 'testing', {});

    expect(stack).toHaveResource("AWS::S3::Bucket", {
        "BucketEncryption": {
            "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": [
                {
                    "ServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                        "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    });

});

test('Does not allow for unencrypted buckets', () => {
    const mockApp = new App();
    const stack = new Stack(mockApp, 'testing-stack');

    new SecureBucket(stack, 'testing', {encryption: BucketEncryption.UNENCRYPTED});

    expect(stack).toHaveResource("AWS::S3::Bucket", {
        "BucketEncryption": {
            "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": [
                {
                    "ServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                        "SSEAlgorithm": "aws:kms"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    });
});

test('Allows override of default encryption', () => {
    const mockApp = new App();
    const stack = new Stack(mockApp, 'testing-stack');

    new SecureBucket(stack, 'testing', {encryption: BucketEncryption.S3_MANAGED});

    expect(stack).toHaveResource("AWS::S3::Bucket", {
        "BucketEncryption": {
            "ServerSideEncryptionConfiguration": [
                {
                    "ServerSideEncryptionByDefault": {
                        "SSEAlgorithm": "AES256"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    });
});

        </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>The code: <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/secure-bucket/blob/master/lib/index.ts" target="_blank">lib/index.ts</a>
    </h2>
    <pre>
        <code class="typescript">
import {Construct} from "@aws-cdk/core";
import {Bucket, BucketEncryption, BucketProps} from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3'

export class SecureBucket extends Construct {

    constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: BucketProps) {
        super(scope, id);

        let newProps: BucketProps = {...props};
        if (!props || props?.encryption === undefined || props?.encryption === BucketEncryption.UNENCRYPTED) {
            // @ts-ignore TS2540
            newProps.encryption = BucketEncryption.KMS_MANAGED;
        }
        new Bucket(this, `${id}-bucket`, newProps);
    }
}
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Once that's setup you can run your unit tests:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ npm run test
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>And we get some test results!</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
> secure-bucket@1.0.0 test /home/mbonig/projects/construct-blog/secure-bucket
> jest

 PASS  lib/index.test.ts
  ✓ Has one encrypted Bucket (59ms)
  ✓ Does not allow for unencrypted buckets (14ms)
  ✓ Allows override of default encryption (10ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.175s
Ran all test suites.

        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now we can build and package the JSII module:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ npm run build

> secure-bucket@1.0.0 build /home/mbonig/projects/construct-blog/secure-bucket
> jsii

$ npm run package

> secure-bucket@1.0.0 package /home/mbonig/projects/construct-blog/secure-bucket
> jsii-pacmak
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Now if you're like me, you're likely to get some errors during the first time you run <i>build</i> and
        <i>package</i> because you need to have the <strong>dotnot</strong> cli, the <strong>mvn</strong> cli and the
        <strong>jdk</strong> installed, and you'll get a warning about <strong>twine</strong> so install that too.
        Google
        for your particular system's favorite package manager for details on getting them installed.
        I run a debian-based distro so it's mostly:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ pip3 install twine --user
$ sudo apt install dotnet maven openjdk
        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Keep running your <i>build</i> and <i>package</i> until all errors are gone. The result should just be a new
        <strong>.jsii</strong> file in the local directory and the
        <strong>dist/</strong> directories getting filled out for our major package managers.</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="shell">
$ ls -al dist
Permissions Size User   Date Modified Git Name
drwxr-xr-x     - mbonig 11 Jan  9:42   -- dist/

        </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Huzzah! We now have a working JSII module that's unit tested and deliverable to the various
        package managers. Now we just have to deliver them! But first, go ahead and push your repository to Github and
        update references in your <strong>package.json</strong> accordingly.</p>
    <p>By the way, all of this code is available <a href="https://github.com/mbonig/secure-bucket"
                                                    target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Github Actions</h2>
    <p>GitHub Actions is a very convienent and cheap automation pipeline. In our case, we're going to use
        <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jsii-publish" target="_blank">Daniel
            Schroeder's Github Action</a> to build and deploy our new JSII construct to NPM, NuGet, PyPi and
        Github (Maven). </p>

    <p>Following the instructions on the linked page is pretty straight forward. You'll have to
        create accounts at all the places you want to publish and generate Access Tokens. Once you have them, <a
                href="https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets"
                target="_blank"> create
            Secrets</a> in your Github Repository. And you should be all set.

    <p>Go ahead now and create a new Tag/Release in your Github Repository and the Action will begin. Review its
        progress. You should see it produce log lines like: </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="text">

        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Of course, your mileage may vary if you decided not to publish to any of those Package Managers (but why would
        you do that?).</p>
</section>
<section class="nice-block">
    <h2>The Construct Catalog</h2>
    <p>In December of 2019 the <a href="https://twitter.com/awscdkio">Construct Catalog</a> was created to index and
        document all
        the fantastic CDK constructs that are being created by the community. If you create a JSII-based construct and
        publish it to NPM with a <strong>keyword</strong> of "cdk", like so:</p>
    <pre>
        <code class="json">
  "keywords": [
    "cdk"
  ]
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Then your construct will automatically be picked up and cataloged by the Construct Catalog!</p>

    <h3>Happy Constructing!</h3>
