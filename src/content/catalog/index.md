# The CDK Construct Catalog

The Construct Catalog was created to expose community developed CDK constructs. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/construct-catalog/catalog).  

# Publishing to the Catalog

Anybody may publish to the CDK Construct Catalog by simply including the keyword "cdk" in your NPM module. Follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/construct-catalog/catalog#publishing-modules).

# Searching the Catalog

The index of all cataloged CDK modules is on Twitter and available through the [awscdkio](https://twitter.com/awscdkio) Twitter handle.
