        <h2><a href="https://twitter.com/mattbonig" target="_blank">Matthew Bonig - President</a></h2>
        <p>Matthew has over 15 years of experience in the application development space, having spent most of his career
        architecting and writing line-of-business applications for various companies around the Denver area. The last couple
        years he's moved into more of a DevOps role for his day-to-day and found the CDK as an invaluable tool to get his
        work done.</p>
