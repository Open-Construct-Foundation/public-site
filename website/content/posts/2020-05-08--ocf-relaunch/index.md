In December of 2019 I launch the Open Construct Foundation website to try to accumulate some knowledge around the CDK.

I was happy when it first launched primarily because it also meant I had done something completely unfamiliar before: launch a non-profit.

Since that launch I've never felt like I had accomplished what I set out to do. Updates were very few in the first few months of the year and then completely dropped off. Mostly I blame thinking that I could lump everything into 3 basic categories (guides, examples, about).

After some consideration (and an experiment with Gatsby) I felt I should relaunch it as a blog. That is the site you see now.

I hope this blog format (and using tags now to categorize content) will allow a quicker and more free-flow update.

As always I'm looking for help in this endeavor. I encourage everything to contribute via [Pull Requests in Github](https://github.com/Open-Construct-Foundation/public-site).
